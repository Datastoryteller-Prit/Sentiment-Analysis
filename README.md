# ðŸ“Œ Real-Time Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project focuses on **real-time sentiment prediction** using a dataset of **1.6 million tweets**.  
The goal is to classify tweets as **positive** or **negative** based on their text content.

---

## ðŸ”„ Data Preprocessing
- Processed **1.6M tweets** by removing noise (URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters).
- Tokenized text and standardized formats (lowercasing, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Transformed text into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis
- Generated **word clouds** for positive and negative tweets to visualize most frequent terms.
- Analyzed sentiment class distribution and vocabulary patterns.

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Building & Evaluation
Implemented and compared multiple models:
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**
- **Linear SVM**
- **Logistic Regression**

Evaluated models using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

The best-performing model was selected for **real-time sentiment prediction**.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Highlights
- Large-scale preprocessing pipeline optimized for millions of tweets.
- Clear visualization of sentiment-specific language.
- Comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification.
